** Summary

The package libmpdel is an Emacs library client to communicate with
[[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]] (MPD), a flexible, powerful, server-side
application for playing music. For a user interface, please check the
[[https://github.com/mpdel/mpdel][mpdel]] project instead (which depends on this one).

** Installing

Get libmpdel from [[https://melpa.org/#/libmpdel][melpa]] or [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/libmpdel][melpa stable]]. You can also clone the git
repository.

You need to install and (quickly) configure an [[https://www.musicpd.org/][MPD server]] if you don't
have any yet. Don't worry, that's simple and you won't regret it.

** Usage

This code is a library and is meant for Emacs Lisp developers. The
source code is well documented and organized in sections. Please have
a look at it.

*** Entities

The library is implemented around a set of entities.

| *Name*           | *Type*    | *Fields*             | *Description*                                           |
|------------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| song             | structure | name, album, file, â€¦ |                                                         |
| album            | structure | name, date, artist   |                                                         |
| artist           | structure | name                 |                                                         |
| directory        | structure | name, path           |                                                         |
| stored-playlist  | structure | name                 | A named user-specified sequence of songs                |
| search-criteria  | structure | type, what           | Read the [[https://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/database.html][protocol documentation]]                         |
| filter           | structure | text                 | Read the [[https://www.musicpd.org/doc/html/protocol.html#filters][protocol documentation]]                         |
|------------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| artists          | symbol    | /none/               | Represent the set of all artists                        |
| albums           | symbol    | /none/               | Represent the set of all albums                         |
| directories      | symbol    | /none/               | Represent all directories in ~libmpdel-music-directory~ |
| current-playlist | symbol    | /none/               | Represent the currently played sequence of songs        |
| stored-playlists | symbol    | /none/               | Represent the set of all stored playlists               |

Many functions in MPDel work on several kinds of entities (e.g.,
~libmpdel-list~). These methods are implemented with ~cl-defgeneric~
and ~cl-defmethod~.
